# 18.369-final-project-report

This repo contains my final project report for the MIT class 18.369 Mathematical Methods in Nanophotonics, taught by Professor Steven Johnson. I used Meep to reproduce and extend the results from https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2015.309. The central file for my report in this repo is apssamp.tex

My code for the project: https://github.com/bli46/18.369_project_thermal_control

Meep is a numerical solver for Maxwell's equations, documented here: https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
